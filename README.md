SpreeSummaryStock
=================

A Spree extension that summarizes all Spree::StockLocation into one location. This lets Spree receive updates for multiple stock locations, but only generate shipments for one. This is useful if:

 1. Your ERP or another third-party system decides on how shipments are generated anyway.
 2. You are using another extension like [spree_handling_fee](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_handling_fees) that generates order adjustments based on each stock location.

Installation
------------

Add spree_summary_stock to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_summary_stock', github: 'onedanshow/spree_summary_stock'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_summary_stock:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_summary_stock/factories'
```
